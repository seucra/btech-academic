# NP-Complete Problems

## Definition
- A problem is **NP-Complete** if:
  1. It belongs to NP.
  2. Every problem in NP can be **reduced to it in polynomial time**.

## Important Points
- NP-Complete problems are the **hardest problems in NP**.
- If any NP-Complete problem is solved in polynomial time → **P = NP**.

## Examples
- SAT (Boolean Satisfiability)
- Hamiltonian Cycle
- Subset Sum
- 3-SAT

## Summary
- NP-Complete = Verifiable in polynomial time + as hard as any NP problem
