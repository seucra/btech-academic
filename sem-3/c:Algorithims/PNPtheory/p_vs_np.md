# P vs NP

## Class P
- P is the set of decision problems that can be **solved in polynomial time**.
- Example: Checking if a number is prime using deterministic algorithms.

## Class NP
- NP is the set of decision problems for which a **given solution can be verified in polynomial time**.
- Example: Sudoku solution verification.

## Key Points
- **P ⊆ NP** (every problem solvable in polynomial time can also be verified in polynomial time).
- **Open Question:** Is P = NP? (unsolved in computer science)
