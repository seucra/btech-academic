# NP-Hard Problems

## Definition
- A problem is **NP-Hard** if solving it in polynomial time would solve **all NP problems** in polynomial time.
- NP-Hard **does not have to be in NP** (may not even be a decision problem).

## Examples
- Travelling Salesperson Problem (optimization version)
- Job Shop Scheduling
- Halting Problem (uncomputable)

## Key Points
- All NP-Complete problems are NP-Hard, but not all NP-Hard problems are NP-Complete.
- Focus: NP-Hard problems are **at least as hard as NP problems**.
